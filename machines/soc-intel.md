## Intel SoC design

- Long time ago, there were CPU, northbridge, and southbridge
  - northbrdige is connected to CPU via FSB and has
    - memory controller
    - PCIe controller (or AGP)
    - CPU frequency is FSB frequency times multiplier
  - southbridge is connected to northbridge via DMI and has
    - pci controller
    - lpc controller (replaces ISA)
    - spi controller (for BIOS flash)
    - smbus (for thermal sensors and fans)
    - dma controller (for pci and lpc devices)
    - i/o apic (for device interrupts)
    - SATA controller
    - RTC
    - HDA controller
    - USB controller
    - super io (keyboard, mouse, serial ports)
- Then there were CPU and PCH
  - northbridge is integrated into CPU die and is called uncore or system
    agent
  - southbridge is replaced by PCH
  - CPU uncore is connected to CPU core via QPI and has
    - LLC
    - memory controller
    - snoop agent
    - thunderbolt controller
  - PCH is connected to CPU via DMI and has
    - everything that southbridge has
- there are still CPU and PCH for desktop; but there is only CPU for mobile
  - system-in-package design
  - CPU die contains CPU core and system agent
  - PCH is integrated into the CPU package as a PCH die
  - PCH die is connected to the CPU die via OPI

## PCI devices

- CPU die
  - PCI host bridge (connecting system bus and PCI bus)
  - Gen GPU
  - HDA controller (for HDMI)
  - processor thermal subsystem
- PCH die
  - USB xHCI controller
  - USB EHCI controller
  - MEI controller
