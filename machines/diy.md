## CPUs

- Intel Core
  - i5: $200 ~ $300
  - i7: $300 ~ $500
- AMD Ryzen
  - 5: $100 ~ $200
  - 7: $200 ~ $500
- TDP
  - OEMs design the cooler to handle TDP watts
    - this is the sustainable watts that cpu can draw
  - cpu draws peak watts when all cores run at boost freq
    - this is not sustainable
  - when cpu draws peak watts, it keeps getting hotter due to the difference
    of `(peak - tdp)` watts
  - until cpu thermal-trottles itself
    - 100C on Core
    - 95C on Ryzen
  - when OEMs design the cooler to handle a specific TDP, high-end and low-end
    cpus having the same TDP have roughly the same sustainable performance
    - the big difference between high-end and low-end is before
      thermal-throttle
- binning
  - after a die is manufactured, it goes through qa
  - each core is tested to see if
    - it can work pre-defined clocks/voltages
    - how is the current leakage
    - if a core is defective, the core is disabled
  - if the cores meet the criteria of a sku, the die is binned to the sku
    - under the same design and process, the difference of the best sku and
      the worst sku can just be manufacturing variances
- what is a good deal?

## Motherboards

- LGA 1700
  - $100 ~ $300
- AM5
  - $100 ~ $300
- considerations
  - chipset
    - e.g., AMD B550
    - 1x M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4
    - 4x SATA
    - 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen2
    - 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen2
    - 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (front)
    - 2x USB-A 2.0 (front)
    - 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen1
      - some motherboards miss this header
    - note that it is capped by the 4-lane PCIE 3.0 interconnect with the cpu
  - wireless
    - e.g., Realtek MT7921K / AMD RZ608
    - 802.11ax
    - BT 5.2
  - audio
    - e.g., Realtek ALC1220-VB hda codec

    - 1x 8-pin cpu power
    - 1x CPU fan header
    - 2x system fan headers
    - 2x LED headers
    - 1x front panel, audio, usb

## Memories

- DDR5 32GB
  - $80 ~ $400
- DDR4 32GB
  - $40 ~ $200
- considerations
  - for ddr5, cpus support 5200MHz/5600MHz officially
    - no need to go beyond 6000MHz and CL 32
  - for ddr4, cpus support 3200MHz officially
    - no need to go beyond 3600MHz and CL 16
  - height can be limited by cases or cpu coolers

## Storage

## CPU Coolers

- $30 ~ $80
- clearances
  - cases have cooler height clearances
    - small cases require low-profile coolers
  - coolers may have ram and io clearances
    - 90x90mm coolers are fine
    - 120x120mm coolers on itx have either ram clearnace or back panel io
      clearnace
- low-profile performance
  - 90x90mm is good enough to sustain TDP 65W cpus
    - height clearance: 37mm - 65mm
  - 120x120mm is needed for 65W cpus to stay at boost freq longer
    - height clearance: 65mm - 70mm
- for small builds emphasizing cpu performance,
  - pick 65W cpu
  - pick 120x120mm cooler
  - pick cases with high cooler height clearance
  - pick low-profile ram or mb with low-profile back io
- decibels
  - midnight background
    - outdoor: 30dB
    - bedroom: 25dB
  - office background
    - meditation: 30dB
    - desk: 40dB
    - kitchen: 55dB
  - x1 carbon gen 9 fan
    - 0rpm / background: 30dB
    - 4500rpm: 30dB (noticeable)
    - 5500rpm: 35dB (acceptable)
    - 6500rpm: 40dB (a bit annoying)
  - white noise
    - muted / background: 30dB
    - 35dB: noticeable
    - 40dB: acceptable
    - 45dB: a bit annoying
    - 50dB: annoying
  - it seems frequencies and background decibels both play a role
    - for fan noises in a 25dB room, 40dB from a distance is acceptable

## PSUs

- 750W
  - $100 ~ $180
- <https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/>
- form factors
  - ATX: 150x86mm, depth is 140mm but can vary
  - SFX: about 125x64mm, depth is 100mm
  - TFX: about 85x65mm, depth is 175mm
  - flex: 81.5x40.5mm, depth is 150mm
  - 1U: less than 1.75in (44.45mm) in height
    - comparing to flex, usually wider, deeper, noisier, and more powerful
  - gan: 55x25mm, depth is 170mm
  - pico: requires external ac-dc adapter
- considerations
  - noise level
    - psus need big heatsinks and big fans which take up space
      - high-efficiency psus reduce wasted heat
    - smaller form factors use smaller heatsinks and smaller fans, which
      require higher rpms
