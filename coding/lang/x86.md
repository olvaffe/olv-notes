x86 Assembly
============

## Syntaxes

- AT&T syntax
  - `mov $0x3, %eax` moves `0x3` to `eax`
  - this is used by binutils and gcc
  - `movl 0x3, %eax` is equivalent to `movl (0x3), %eax` and is different from
    `mov $0x3, %eax`
- Intel syntax
  - `mov eax, 0x3` moves `0x3` to `eax`
  - this is used by most assemblers/disassemblers

## Calling Conventions

- System V AMD64 ABI
  - integer args are in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, and `r9`
  - float args are in `xmm0` to `xmm7`
  - excess args are in stack
  - return value is in `rax` and `rdx`
  - callee must preserve `rbx`, `rsp`, `rbp`, and `r12` to `r15`
- Linux x86-64 Syscall ABI
  - syscall number is in `rax`
  - args are in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `r10`, `r8`, and `r9`
    - note how `r10` is used instead of `rcx`
    - this is because `syscall` saves return addr to `rcx`

## Registers

- rax is bit 0..63
  - eax is bit 0..31
  - ax is bit 0..15
  - al is bit 0..7
  - ah is bit 8..15

## Instructions

- `mov 0x4(%r13,%rax,8), %rdx` means `%rdx = *(%r13 + %rax * 8 + 0x4)`
  - this can happen with `val = elems[i].field`
- `lea 0x4(%r13,%rax,8), %rdx` means `%rdx = %r13 + %rax * 8 + 0x4`
  - this can happen with `val = &elems[i].field`
  - `lea` is also often used for pure arithmetics
- `push %rbp` means `*(--%rsp) = %rbp`
- `pop %rbp` means `*(%rsp++) = %rbp`
- `call $addr` means `push %rip; jmp $addr`
  - `rip` points to the next instruction
- `ret` means `pop %rip`
- `enter` means `push %rbp; mov %rsp, %rbp; sub $N, %rsp`
  - it is never used because it is slower than the expanded 3 instructions
- `leave` means `mov %rbp, %rsp; pop %rbp`

## Stack

- the stack is a piece of memory allocated by the kernel before the program
  runs
  - it is effectively a `MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_GROWSDOWN` anon map
    whose size is `RLIMIT_STACK` (often 8MB) and who ends near the top of the
    userspace address space (often `1ull<<47` rounded down to page)
  - the kernel uses the stack to pass metadata to the userspace
    - such as those accessible through `argc`, `argv`, `envp`, `getauxval`,
      etc.
  - `rsp` points to the "end" of kernel-generated metadata
    - the stack grows downward so `rsp` is the lowest address of
      kernel-generated data
    - the content at the address is `argc` fwiw
- stack frames
  - a stack frame is a region allocated from the stack
    - it holds the state of a subroutine
    - `rbp` points to the start (top, inclusive) of the stack frame
      - it is known as the frame pointer or base pointer
    - `rsp` points to the end (bottom, inclusive) of the stack frame
      - it is known as the stack pointer
  - when a caller calls a subroutine,
    - caller
      - `call $addr`, which is `push %rip; jmp $addr`
    - callee prologue
      - `push %rbp`
      - `mov %rsp, %rbp`
      - `sub $size, %rsp`
        - `$size` is an immediate known at compile-time
        - `[%rbp, %rsp]` is now the stack frame of the callee
    - callee epilogue
      - `leave`, which is `mov %rbp, %rsp; pop %rbp`
        - `[%rbp, %rsp]` is now the stack frame of the caller
      - `ret`, which is `pop %rip`
- `-fomit-frame-pointer`
  - when the size of a stack frame is known that compile-time, we can derive
    `ebp` from `esp`, which allows `ebp` to be used as a general register
    instead
  - the sizes of most stack frames are known at compile-time
    - exceptions are subroutines that use `alloca`
- first stack frame
  - gdb backtrace stops at `main` intentionally
  - if looking at the raw stack frame, `main`'s return address is inside
    `__libc_start_call_main`

## Segmentation

- real mode
  - the address space is 20-bit (1MB)
  - but each segment is 16-bit (64KB)
  - the effective addr is `(segment << 4) + offset`, where
    - `segment` is the value of the 16-bit segment register
  - `cs` is for instruction fetch (`cs:ip` is the next instr)
  - `ds` is for data fetch
  - `ss` is for stack (`ss:sp` is the stack pos)
  - `es` is for string (`movs` moves from `ds:si` to `es:di`)
- protected mode
  - segment registers are 16-bit but have become descriptors
    - 13-bit for index into the descriptor table
    - 2-bit for requested privilege level
    - 1-bit for table indicator
  - privilege check is `DPL < max(CPL, RPL)`
    - `DPL` is the descriptor privilege level of the segment
    - `RPL` is the requested privilege level
    - `CPL` is the current privilege level, which is the `RPL` of `cs`.
    - A `GP` fault is generated if the inequality holds
    - Otherwise, access is granted.
  - All, but `cs`, can be modified directly
    - because `cs` gives `CPL`
  - The only way to raise `CPL` is through `lcall` or `int`
  - thera are also `fs` and `gs` for general-purpose
- long (64-bit) mode
  - `cs`, `ds`, `ss`, `es` are forced to have base addr 0 and size limit 2^64
  - `fs` is typically for userspace tls
    - it finds base addr in `MSR_FS_BASE` reg
    - userspace uses `WRFSBASE` instr to modify the msr reg
      - userspace used to make `ARCH_SET_FS` syscall
  - `gs` is typically for kernel per-cpu data
    - upon kernel entry, kernel uses `SWAPGS` instr to swtich to
      `MSR_KERNEL_GS_BASE`, which it uses for per-cpu data
    - upon kernel exit, kernel uses `SWAPGS` instr again to restore userspace
      `gs`
