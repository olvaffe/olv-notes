x86 Assembly
============

## Syntaxes

- AT&T syntax
  - `mov $0x3, %eax` moves `0x3` to `eax`
  - this is used binutils and gcc
- Intel syntax
  - `mov eax, 0x3` moves `0x3` to `eax`
  - this is used by most assemblers/disassemblers

## Calling Conventions

- System V AMD64 ABI
  - integer args are in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, and `r9`
  - float args are in `xmm0` to `xmm7`
  - excess args are in stack
  - return value is in `rax` and `rdx`
  - callee must preserve `rbx`, `rsp`, `rbp`, and `r12` to `r15`
- Linux x86-64 Syscall ABI
  - syscall number is in `rax`
  - args are in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `r10`, `r8`, and `r9`
    - note how `r10` is used instead of `rcx`
    - this is because `syscall` saves return addr to `rcx`

## Instructions

- `mov 0x4(%r13,%rax,8), %rdx` means `%rdx = *(%r13 + %rax * 8 + 0x4)`
  - this can happen with `val = elems[i].field`
- `lea 0x4(%r13,%rax,8), %rdx` means `%rdx = %r13 + %rax * 8 + 0x4`
  - this can happen with `val = &elems[i].field`
  - `lea` is also often used for pure arithmetics
- `push %rbp` means `*(--%rsp) = %rbp`
- `pop %rbp` means `*(%rsp++) = %rbp`
- `call $addr` means `push %rip; jmp $addr`
  - `rip` points to the next instruction
- `ret` means `pop %rip`
- `enter` means `push %rbp; mov %rsp, %rbp; sub $N, %rsp`
  - it is never used because it is slower than the expanded 3 instructions
- `leave` means `mov %rbp, %rsp; pop %rbp`

## Stack

- the stack is a piece of memory allocated by the kernel before the program
  runs
  - it is effectively a `MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_GROWSDOWN` anon map
    whose size is `RLIMIT_STACK` (often 8MB) and who ends near the top of the
    userspace address space (often `1ull<<47` rounded down to page)
  - the kernel uses the stack to pass metadata to the userspace
    - such as those accessible through `argc`, `argv`, `envp`, `getauxval`,
      etc.
  - `rsp` points to the "end" of kernel-generated metadata
    - the stack grows downward so `rsp` is the lowest address of
      kernel-generated data
    - the content at the address is `argc` fwiw
- stack frames
  - a stack frame is a region allocated from the stack
    - it holds the state of a subroutine
    - `rbp` points to the start (top, inclusive) of the stack frame
      - it is known as the frame pointer or base pointer
    - `rsp` points to the end (bottom, inclusive) of the stack frame
      - it is known as the stack pointer
  - when a caller calls a subroutine,
    - caller
      - `call $addr`, which is `push %rip; jmp $addr`
    - callee prologue
      - `push %rbp`
      - `mov %rsp, %rbp`
      - `sub $size, %rsp`
        - `$size` is an immediate known at compile-time
        - `[%rbp, %rsp]` is now the stack frame of the callee
    - callee epilogue
      - `leave`, which is `mov %rbp, %rsp; pop %rbp`
        - `[%rbp, %rsp]` is now the stack frame of the caller
      - `ret`, which is `pop %rip`
- `-fomit-frame-pointer`
  - when the size of a stack frame is known that compile-time, we can derive
    `ebp` from `esp`, which allows `ebp` to be used as a general register
    instead
  - the sizes of most stack frames are known at compile-time
    - exceptions are subroutines that use `alloca`
- first stack frame
  - gdb backtrace stops at `main` intentionally
  - if looking at the raw stack frame, `main`'s return address is inside
    `__libc_start_call_main`

## Syntax

- `movl 3, %eax` is equivalent to `movl (3), %eax` and is different from
  `mov $3, %eax`.

## EAX

- 32...16...8..0
- EAX is all
- AX is lower 16
- AL is lower 8
- AH is higer 8 of AX

## mov

- On 32-bits,
  - `movl` to `eax` is `B8`, and takes 4 bytes value
  - `movw` to `ax` is `66 B8`, and takes 2 bytes value
  - `movb` to `al` is `B0`, and takes 1 bytes value
- On 16-bits,
  - `movl` to `eax` is `66 B8`, and takes 4 bytes value
  - `movw` to `ax` is `B8`, and takes 2 bytes value
  - `movb` to `al` is `B0`, and takes 1 bytes value

## Jump

- short jump `EB xx`, `xx` is the signed offset from current `ip`
- near jump `E9 xx xx`, `xx xx` is the signed offset from current `ip`
- long jump `EA xx xx yy yy`, `xx xx` is the absolute address and `yy yy` is
  the new segment.  For 32-bits, the absolute address is 4 bytes.
- On 32-bits,
  - `EA` is ljmp and takes 4 bytes address
  - `66 EA` is ljmpw and takes 2 bytes address
- On 16-bits,
  - `EA` is ljmp and takes 2 bytes address
  - `66 EA` is ljmpl and takes 4 bytes address

## `mov` and `lea`

- `movl $123,%eax` is the same as `leal (123),%eax` or `leal 3(120),%eax`
- `leal`, despite its syntax, does not access the memory.  It stores the address
  of the memory, which whould otherwise be accessed by other instructions.

## Kernel syscall

- for kernel syscalls,
  - `%eax` holds the number
  - `%ebx`, `%ecx`, `%edx`, `%esi`, `%edi`, `%ebp` hold the first 6 arguments

## Segmentation

- There are `cs`, `ds`, `ss`, `es`, `fs`, `gs`.
- One may `movl $42, %fs:(%eax)`
- But usually, implied segments are used.
- Instruction fetches use `cs`, code segment.
  - Or, `cs:ip` points to the next instruction
- Most memory references use `ds`, data segment.
- Stack references through `esp`, `ebp`, or `push`, `pop` use `ss`, stack
  segment.
  - Or, `ss:sp` points to the current position of the stack.
- String instructions like `stos` use `es`, extended segment.
  - Or, `ds:si` is copied into `es:di`.
- A segment register is 16-bits
  - 13-bit for index into the descriptor table
  - 2-bit for requested privilege level
  - 1-bit for table indicator
- The privilege check is `DPL < max(CPL, RPL)`
  - `DPL` is the descriptor privilege level of the segment
  - `RPL` is the requested privilege level
  - `CPL` is the current privilege level, which is the `RPL` of `cs`.
  - A `GP` fault is generated if the inequality holds
  - Otherwise, access is granted.
- All, but `cs`, can be modified directly
  - because `cs` gives `CPL`.
- The only way to raise `CPL` is through `lcall` or `int`.
