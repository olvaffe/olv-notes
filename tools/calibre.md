  - Adobe Adept
  - Barnes & Noble
  - Amazon Mobipocket
  - Amazon Topaz
  - Microsoft
  - eReader
  - Apple Fairplay
- DRM formats
  - the e-book is downloaded encrypted with the serial number of the device.
    - only the device can open the e-book
- some platforms provide the option to download ebooks
  - e.g., google play, kobo, libby, etc.
    - for libby, once the reading option is selected for a rental, it is
      locked
  - if the ebook is not drm protected, it typically downloads as plain pdf or epub
  - otherwise, they typically use ADEPT (Adobe Digital Experience Protection
    Technology) and the ebook is downloaded as a small `.acsm` file
  - an `.acsm` file is a text file describing the ebook to the adobe server
    - the resource is identified by a uuid
    - the `.acsm` file has an expiration
    - if rented, there is also an retal expiration
  - ADE (adobe digital editions) can download the encrypted pdf or epub from
    the adobe server using the `.acsm` file
- Adobe Adept
  - <https://blog.soutade.fr/post/2021/05/acsm-to-epub-without-wineade-linux-armv7-only.html>
    - adobe provides `librmsdk.so` to parse an `.acsm` file and to download
      the encrypted pdf/epub from ACS (Adobe Content Server)
    - <https://forge.soutade.fr/soutade/ACSMDownloader.git> is a open-source
      client of `librmsdk.so`
      - it looks for these files in `.adept` and `.adobe-digital-editions`
        - `device.xml` is the device file (of the ereader)
          - this descirbes the ereader (serial, name, rmsdk version, etc.)
        - `activation.xml` is the activation file (of the ereader)
          - this is generated by activating the device with adobe
          - it contains the adept cert and the user info
        - `devicesalt` is the device key file (of the ereader)
      - `dp::getVersionInfo` gets the rmsdk version
      - `dp::platformInit`
      - `dp::cryptRegisterOpenSSL()`
      - `dp::documentRegisterEPUB()`
      - `dp::documentRegisterPDF()`
      - `MockDevice` simulates a ereader using the device files
        - `dpdev::DeviceProvider::addProvider`
        - `dpnet::NetProvider::setProvider`
        - `rmsdk::getProvider` returns `dpdrm::DRMProvider`
  - <https://forge.soutade.fr/soutade/libgourou> is a open-source impl of
    ADEPT client (similar to `librmsdk.so`)
    - `adept_activate` activates a device
      - it activates with acs and saves device files to `~/.config/adept`
      - this includes the private key to decrypt pdf/epub
  - <https://github.com/Leseratte10/acsm-calibre-plugin> is a rewrite in
    python for calibre

## Calibre

- plugins
  - `Preferences -> Advanced -> Plugins`
    - plugins are installed to `~/.config/calibre/plugins`
  - `Get new plugins`
    - `DeACSM` downloads epub/pdf specified by `.acsm` file from adobe server
      - <https://github.com/Leseratte10/acsm-calibre-plugin>
      - configure the plugin to log in with adobe id
      - adding `.acsm` as a book downloads encrypted epub/pdf from the server
  - `Load plugin from file`
    - `DeDRM` decrypts adobe adept drm
      - <https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools>
      - `./make_release.py && unzip DeDRM_tools.zip DeDRM_plugin.zip`
      - it imports keys from `DeACSM` automatically, or configure the plugin
        to add manually
