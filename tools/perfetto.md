## Overview

- processes
  - there is a tracing service, `tracebox traced`
  - there are producers that connect to `traced`
    - `tracebox traced_probes`
    - every app that uses the tracing SDK
  - there is a consumer who can config, start, and stop tracing sessions
    - `tracebox perfetto`
- tracing data overflow
  - each producer has a shared memory with `traced`
  - a producer can have several data sources
    - `traced_probes` has ftrace, `/proc/stat`, etc. as its data sources
    - different components of an app can be difference data sources
  - each data source writes `TracePacket` protos to the shared memory
    - the raw data are minimally parsed into protos
  - the consumer has one (or more) shared memory with `traced`
    - `traced` moves and mixes `TracePacket` protos from producer shared
      memories to the consumer shared memories
  - the consumer saves `TracePaket` protos to file
- analysis of a trace file
  - a `TraceProcessor` is a library that takes a trace file as an input,
    parses it into a in-memory SQL db, and provides SQL API to its clients
  - `TraceProcessor` supports native perfetto trace file, or other legacy
    trace files
    - android systrace
    - chrome json
- source tree
  - `src/tracing` and `include/perfetto/tracing` are most of the SDK
    - SDK supports in-process server and has server code
    - it has client code to connect to the system server or to the in-process
      server
    - it has `DataSource` that can be used to implement any producer
    - it has `TrackEventDataSource` that implmement a producer that can
      produce `TrackEvent`
  - `src/traced/service` is `tracebox traced`
  - `src/traced/probes` is `tracebox traced_probes`
  - `src/profiling/perf` is `tracebox traced_perf`
  - `src/perfetto_cmd` is `tracebox perfetto`
  - `protos` is the protobuf definitions
    - `perfetto/trace/trace.proto` defines the protobuf for a trace file
    - `perfetto/config/trace_config.proto` defines the protobuf for a trace config file
    - `perfetto/ipc` probably defines the protobuf for
      traced/producer/consumer IPC
    - `perfetto/trace_processor` probably defines the protobuf for
      `trace_processor` and ui IPC
      - `trace_processor` loads a trace file and provide a SQL interface to
      	clients
    - `perfetto/trace/perfetto_trace.proto` and
      `perfetto/config/perfetto_config.proto`
      - these are generated by concatenating all other files
      - they are for use by external projects
  - `ui` is the web app

## Internals Overview

- `traced`
  - `TracingService` is the service
  - `ProducerEndpoint` is a connection to a producer
  - `ConsumerEndpoint` is a connection to a consumer
  - for example, when `traced` wants to set up a data source,
    - `TracingServiceImpl::SetupDataSource`
    - `TracingServiceImpl::ProducerEndpointImpl::SetupDataSource`
    - `ProducerIPCService::RemoteProducer::SetupDataSource`
    - send the request to the remote producer process
- `traced_probes`
- an SDK embedder
  - `TracingBackend` is a connection to the system server or in-process server
  - `TracingMuxerImpl` is a wrapper of `TracingBackend`
  - `Producer` is for when the embedder is a producer
  - `Consumer` is for when the embedder is a consumer
  - for example, when `traced` wants to set up a data source,
    - receive the request from the server
    - `ProducerIPCClientImpl::OnServiceRequest`
    - `TracingMuxerImpl::ProducerImpl::SetupDataSource`
    - `TracingMuxerImpl::SetupDataSource`
  - when the embedder wants to generate a trace event
    - first of all, the embedder is a producer
    - the embedder calls `DataSource::Trace` with a embedder's callback to
      generate the trace event
      - the callback is called only when the data source is enabled
    - the callback is called with a `TraceContext`
      - `GetDataSourceLocked` returns a pointer to the `DataSource` object
      - `GetIncrementalState` returns a pointer to an embedder-defined
      	struct associated with the data source
      	- the struct is defined by subclassing `DefaultDataSourceTraits` and
      	  overriding `IncrementalStateType`
      	- the struct stores "incremental state"
      	- the struct might be freed and re-created by `GetIncrementalState`
      	- to reduce trace data size, perfetto uses data interning
      	  - e.g., the producer can generate a string table upfront
	  - future packets generated by the producer can refer to the string
	    table to reduce packet size
	  - this string table is known as "incremental state"
	- the incremental state can get lost in the server
	  - e.g., tracing using a ring buffer and the incremental state gets
	    dropped
	  - when that happens, the server notifices the producer to
	    re-generate the incrementa state
      - `NewTracePacket`
    - `TRACE_EVENT` and variants internally use `TrackEventDataSource`, which
      is a data source implemented by the SDK
      - it works the same way as any embedder-defined data source
      - it has the concept of "categories"

## Tools

- `traceconv` to convert protobuf binary to protobuf text, systrace, etc.
  - protoc can be used to decode binary to txt as well
    - `protoc --decode=perfetto.protos.Trace protos/perfetto/trace/perfetto_trace.proto`
  - protoc can support encode which `traceconv` can't
- `trace_processor_shell` is a sql shell
  - `.dump <file>` to save to sqlite
  - `select * from track` shows all tracks
  - `select * from thread_track` shows all tracks that are threads
    - perfetto uses an OO design
  - `select * from slice` shows all slices
- newbie way
  - `select utid from thread where name == blah` to find `utid` of `blah`
  - `select id from thread_track where utid == foo` to find the track id
  - `select ts, dur, name, depth from slice where track_id == bar order by ts`
    to find the slices

## Release Process

- `master` is the development branch
- `ui.perfetto.dev` uses `ui/release/channels.json`
  - user can pick from `stable`, `canary`, or `autopush` channels
  - `autopush` channel uses master tot
  - `canary` uses `ui-canary` branch
    - every 1-2 weeks, `master` is merged to `ui-canary` and the json file is
      updated
    - there can also be cherry-picks to fix issues
  - `stable` uses `ui-stable` branch
    - every 4 weeks, `ui-canary` is merged to `ui-stable` and the json file is
      updated
    - there can also be cherry-picks to fix issues
- SDK releases
  - once in a while, `releases/v<VER>.x` is branched from master
  - `tools/gen_amalgamated --output sdk/perfetto`
  - `git add sdk/perfetto.{cc,h}`
  - `git commit -m "Amalgamated source for vX.Y"`

## Use

- `PERFETTO_DEFINE_CATEGORIES(perfetto::Category("blah"))`
  - this defines a constexpr `kCategories` array
  - and declares a `g_category_state_storage` `std::atomic<uint8_t>` array
  - and defines `kConstExprCategoryRegistry` to wrap above
  - defines a new struct type, `TrackEvent` inheriting `DataSource`
- `PERFETTO_TRACK_EVENT_STATIC_STORAGE()`
  - definitions of declarations in `PERFETTO_DEFINE_CATEGORIES`
- `perfetto::Tracing::Initialize`
  - calls `Tracing::InitializeInternal`
- `perfetto::TrackEvent::Register`
  - builds `DataSourceDescriptor` proto
  - calls `TracingMuxerImpl::RegisterDataSource`
- `TRACE_EVENT_BEGIN("blah", "SliceName")`
  - `IsDynamicCategory` is false when used this way
  - compute the index of "blah" at compile-time
  - calls `TrackEventCategoryRegistry::GetCategoryState` to find out whether
    the category is enabled or not
  - if enabled, call `TrackEventDataSource::TraceForCategory` and write a
    `TracePacket`
- `TRACE_EVENT_END("blah")`
  - takes the same path as `TRACE_EVENT_BEGIN`, but with
    `TrackEvent::TYPE_SLICE_END` instead of `TrackEvent::TYPE_SLICE_BEGIN`
- the app is a producer and receives commands from the service to
  setup/start/stop data sources
  - `OnSetup`/`OnStart`/`OnStop` of `TrackEventDataSource` are called from
    `TracingMuxerImpl`
  - they will call `TrackEventInternal::EnableTracing` or
    `TrackEventInternal::DisableTracing`

## `TracingMuxerImpl`

- in-process backend
  - the process runs the service and consumers as well
  - used to collect trace events just for the app (e.g., chrome does this)
- system backend
 - the process is just a producer
 - used to collect trace events in the system-wide profiling
- `TracingMuxerImpl`
  - `Initialize`, for each backend, calls `ConnectProducer` (e.g.,
    `SystemTracingBackend::ConnectProducer`) to create an endpoint and wraps
    it in a `TracingMuxerImpl::ProducerImpl` 
  - for system backend, this connects to the system-wide producer socket.
  - `ProducerIPCClientImpl::OnServiceRequest` is called for requests from the
    service.  It calls back to `TracingMuxerImpl::ProducerImpl` for things
    such as `SetupDataSource`, `StartDataSource`, or `StopDataSource`

## SQL

- <https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/sql-tables>
- object-oriented tables

  - `thread_track` table
    - additional columns: `utid`
  - `process_track` table
    - additional columns: `utid`

## protobuf

- implementations
  - the official one is <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf>
  - C library, <https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c>
  - minimal and high-performance, <https://github.com/mapbox/protozero>
  - perfetto has yet another implementation that is also called protozero,
    <https://perfetto.dev/docs/design-docs/protozero>
- `protos/perfetto/trace/trace.proto`
  - `Trace`
    - `packet` is a sequence of `TracePacket`
  - `TracePacket`
    - `timestamp_clock_id` and `timestamp` are the clock and timestamp of the
      packet
    - `trusted_uid` and `trusted_pid` are service-written uid/pid of the producer
    - `trusted_packet_sequence_id` is service-written id that uniquely
      identified producer+writer in this session
    - `interned_data` for data interning to reduce trace size
    - `trace_packet_defaults` provides default values to reduce trace size
    - `previous_packet_dropped`
    - `sequence_flags`
      - `SEQ_INCREMENTAL_STATE_CLEARED` means prior incremental data (e.g.,
        `interned_data`, `trace_packet_defaults`) will no longer be referenced
      	by this or future packets
      - `SEQ_NEEDS_INCREMENTAL_STATE` means this packet requires valid
      	incremental data to parse
    - `data` is one of many possible payloads, such as
      - misc
        - `ClockSnapshot`
        - `TraceConfig`
        - `CpuInfo`
        - `FtraceEventBundle`
      - track-related
	- `TrackDescriptor` describes a track
	  - that is, a row in the trace viewer
	  - there is a track for each process and thread
        - `TrackEvent` describes a track event
          - an event on a track
          - slice begin/end, instance, counter
      - gpu-related
        - `FrameTimelineEvent`
        - `GpuCounterEvent`
        - `GpuLog`
        - `GpuMemTotalEvent`
        - `GpuRenderStageEvent`
        - `GraphicsFrameEvent`
        - `VulkanApiEvent`
        - `VulkanMemoryEvent`
  - `TrackEvent`
- <https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/>
  - unsigned 64-bit ints are encoded as varints
    - a 64-bit uint takes one to ten bytes
    - each byte represents 7 bits of the uint, from LSB to MSB of the int
      - if the MSB of the byte is 0, this is the last byte
      - otherwise, there are more bytes
    - small uints take fewer bytes
  - a message is encoded as a sequence of `(tag, value)` pairs
    - a `tag` is a uint encoded as varint
      - `tag & 7` is the type of the field
      - `tag >> 3` is the id of the field
    - type 0: int32, int64, uint32, uint64, sint32, sint64, bool, enum
      - `value` is also a uint encoded as varint
    - type 1: fixed64, sfixed64, double
      - `value` has a fixed width of 64 bits
    - type 2: string, bytes, embedded messages, packed repeated fields
      - `value` is a varint, which denotes the length, followed by length
        bytes
    - type 5: fixed32, sfixed32, float
      - `value` has a fixed width of 32 bits

## Host/Guest Time Sync

- Host
  - one of the producers must use modified SDK, such as perCetto, to take
    special clock snapshots
  - in `PercettoDataSource::DoIncrementalUpdate`, perCetto adds a trace packet
    with two clocks
    - one has `clock_id` `BUILTIN_CLOCK_BOOTTIME` (or
      `BUILTIN_CLOCK_MONOTONIC`) and `timestamp` from
      `clock_gettime(CLOCK_BOOTTIME or CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`
    - one has `clock_id` `kCpuCounterClockId (64)` and `timestamp` from
      `rdtsc` (x86) or `cntvct` (arm) to count cpu cycles
- Guest
  - one of the producers must use modified SDK or generate track events with
    special debug annotations
  - in `tick_forever`, `com.google.perfettoguesttimesync` generates
    `cros/guest_clock_sync` track events with debug annotations
    - `clock_sync_boottime` is from `clock_gettime(CLOCK_BOOTTIME)`
    - `clock_sync_monotonic` is from `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`
    - `clock_sync_cputime` is from `rdtsc` (x86) or `cntvct` (arm) to count
      cpu cycles
- `vperfetto_merge`
  - `getTraceCpuTimeSync` computes `TraceCpuTimeSync` using clock snapshots
  - these use the last snapshot
    - `clockId` is `BUILTIN_CLOCK_BOOTTIME` or `BUILTIN_CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
    - `clockTime` is `clock_gettime`
    - `cpuTime` is cpu cycle count
  - this use the first and the last snapshot
    - `cpuCyclesPerNano` is "cpu cycle delta" divided by "clock time delta"
