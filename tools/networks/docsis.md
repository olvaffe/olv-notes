## MoCA

- Multimedia over Coax Alliance
- MoCA 1.0, 2006, 135Mb/s
- MoCA 1.1, 2007, 175Mb/s
- MoCA 2.0, 2010, 500Mb/s
- MoCA 2.5, 2016, 2500Mb/s
- MoCA 3.0, 202x, 10Gb/s

## Equipments

- A CMTS, cable modem termination system, has N downstream ports and 4 to 6
  times for upstream ports
  - each downstream port is usually connected to 4 to 6 neighborhoods while
    each upstream port is connected to one neighborhood, because the return
    path is more noisy
- A CMTS has full control over the modem's configuration
- The traffic is encrypted such that two customers cannot listen to each
  other's traffic
  - it also allows the operator to refuse service to uncertified modems or
    unauthorized customers
