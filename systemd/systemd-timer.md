systemd timer
=============

## Timer Units

- there is `at`
  - <http://blog.calhariz.com/index.php/tag/at>
    - git repo <https://salsa.debian.org/debian/at>
  - a user invokes `at` to submit a job
    - `at` is suid and is owned by `daemon`
      - that is, euid will be `daemon` when executing
      - but `at` calls `setreuid` immediately to swap euid and ruid
    - it checks `/etc/at.allow` and `/etc/at.deny` to determine if user can
      submit jobs
      - `man 2 access` says fs perm is based on ruid
    - it creates a file (job) under `/var/spool/cron/atjobs`
      - `man 2 open` says the euid will be the file owner
      - the contents of the file is a script to
        - a comment that contains uid/gid/mail
        - restore the env
        - cd to cwd
        - execute the user-speicified commands
    - it sends `SIGHUP` to wake up atd
      - `/run/atd.pid` has the pid
  - `atd` is a daemon
    - it runs as `root` but set euid to `daemon`
    - it sleeps inside a main loop most of the time
    - when woken up, it scans `/var/spool/cron/atjobs`
      - for each job that is ready, it forks a child to run the job
      - it then sleeps until the next job is ready
    - when running a job in a child,
      - it parses the comment at the beginning for uid/gid/mail
      - it `setuid`/`setgid` to become the uid/gid
      - it invokes `/bin/sh` to run the script and redirects stdout/stderr to
        a file under `/var/spool/cron/atspool`
      - it invokes `sendmail -i <user>` to send the stdout/stderr to the user
- there is `cron`
  - `crontab` updates `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/<user>`
    - it is setgid
    - it checks `/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` to determine if user
      can use cron
  - `cron` is a daemon
    - it scans `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` for user crontabs
    - it also scans `/etc/cron.d` and `/etc/crontabs` for system crontabs
    - there are usually system crontabs to run all executables under these
      directories periodically
      - `/etc/cron.daily`
      - `/etc/cron.hourly`
      - `/etc/cron.weekly`
      - `/etc/cron.monthly`
- systemd provides timers
  - `foo.timer`
    - `[Timer]` section defines when does the timer activate and which unit to
      activate
