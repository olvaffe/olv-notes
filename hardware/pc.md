## CPUs

- Intel Core
  - i5: $200 ~ $300
  - i7: $300 ~ $400
- AMD Ryzen
  - 5: $200 ~ $300
  - 7: $300 ~ $400
- TDP
  - mid-range: 65W
  - high-end: 120W+
  - OEMs design the cooler to handle TDP watts
    - this is the sustainable watts that cpu can draw
  - cpu draws peak watts when all cores run at boost freq
    - this is not sustainable
  - when cpu draws peak watts, it keeps getting hotter due to the difference
    of `(peak - tdp)` watts until cpu thermal-trottles itself
    - 100C on Core
    - 95C on Ryzen
  - if two CPUs have the same uarch, TDP, and cooler, but different core
    count/freq,
    - the better cpu might have higher peak watt and thus perform better
      during boost
    - when they both draw the same tdp watt and allocate them to cores evenly,
      the better cpu allocates less watt for each core
      - cores on the two cpus might run at the same freq because the better
        cpu has less leakage
      - or, cores on better cpu might run at lower freq but are more efficient
        - watts have diminishing returns
- binning
  - after a die is manufactured, it goes through qa
  - each core is tested to see if
    - it can work pre-defined clocks/voltages
    - how is the current leakage
    - if a core is defective, the core is disabled
  - if the cores meet the criteria of a sku, the die is binned to the sku
    - under the same design and process, the difference of the best sku and
      the worst sku can just be manufacturing variances
- what is a good deal?

  - Package Power Control
  - PL1 is the average power threshold
    - power can sustain at PL1 forever
    - it is recommended to set to tdp and must not exceed cooling limit
  - PL2 is the burst power threshold
    - cpu power limiting kicks in whenever there are spikes above PL2

## Memories

- DDR5 32GB
  - $80 ~ $400
- DDR4 32GB
  - $40 ~ $200
- module height can be limited by cases or cpu coolers
- DDR4
  - JEDEC defines up to DDR4-3200
    - Core and Ryzen both support DDR4-3200
  - Intel XMP 2.0 and AMD DOCP can overclock
    - the sweet spot is said to be 3600MHz and CL 16
- DDR5
  - JEDEC defines up to DDR5-6400
    - Core supports DDR5-5600
    - Ryzen supports DDR5-5200
  - Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO can overclock
    - the sweet spot is said to be 6000MHz and CL 30
- Bandwidth
  - DDR5-5600 means 5600 MT/s
    - the bus runs at 2800 MHz and DDR means 2 transactions per clock
    - the bus is 64-bit wide and dual-channel means 128-bit per transaction
    - the bandwidth is thus `5600 * 128 / 8 / 1024 = 87.5 GB/s` if dual-channel
  - DDR4-3200 means 3200 MT/s
    - the bandwidth is `3200 * 128 / 8 / 1024 = 50.0 GB/s` if dual-channel
  - LPDDR4X-4267 means 4267 MT/s
    - the bus is 32-bit wide and dual-channel means 64-bit per transaction
    - the bandwidth is `4267 * 64 / 8 / 1024 = 33.3 GB/s` if dual-channel
- in practice
  - the memory controller typically supports 2 channels
  - a mobo typically has 2 dimms per channel
    - to benefit from dual-channel, install ddr5 modules to different channels
  - a 16GB ddr5 module typically has 8 16Gb ddr5 dies on one side
    - those dies on the same side are called a rank
    - the module is thus referred to as 1Rx8 (1 rank, 8 dies)
    - avoid 8GB ddr5 modules
      - they are 1Rx4
      - the memory controller accesses an entire rank at a time, and it is a
        waste when a rank only has 4 dies
  - a 32GB ddr5 module typically is 2Rx8 (2 ranks, 8 dies each)
    - the memory controller can do rank interleaving and is slightly faster
    - but only if the freq is not reduced due to having to access both ranks
- power consumption
  - a 16GB DDR5 module consumes 3W on idle and 6-9W on busy
- ddr5 die
  - the major die manufacturers are samsung, sk hynix, and micron
  - it consists of, hierarchically,
    - several bank groups
    - within each bank group, there are banks
    - within each bank, there are memory arrays
    - within each memory array, there are capacitors to store bits
  - a physical address thus consists of `(bank group, bank, row, col)`
  - 16Gb die
    - possible column widths are x4, x8, or x16
    - that is, each column in a memory array has 4-bit, 8-bit, or 16-bit
    - aka DQ
- ddr5 module
  - a 16GB module is typically 1Rx8
    - there are x8 16Gb die on one side of the module
  - ddr5 bus width is 32x2-bit
    - there are two 32-bit subchannels that work independently
  - default burst length is 16, aka BL16
    - each burst transfers `32*16/8=64` bytes for each subchannel

  - pico: requires external ac-dc adapter

    fans)

  - noise level

      - high-efficiency psus reduce wasted heat
    - smaller form factors use smaller heatsinks and smaller fans, which
      require higher rpms

    - 2025: USB-C, BT (proprietary), $90
- 8BitDo
  - most controllers can switch between DirectInput and XInput modes
    - some can do Switch mode for Nintendo Switch
    - no PS5 support
  - wireless or 2.4G: proprietary protocol that requires a dongle on the host
    - dongle appears as a wired controller to the host
  - bt: emulate switch proprietary protocol just for switch
- Win APIs
  - DirectInput: older, wider varities, lower-level, higher flexibility
  - XInput: introduced with Xbox 360
- Linux
  - if controller supports bt HIDP or HOGP profile, bluez uses `uhid` to
    create a kernel hid device
  - kernel hid drivers
    - hid-generic can support basic functions
    - special drivers can support more functions
  - userspace hid drivers
    - hidraw allows userspace to talk to kernel hid device directly
- SDL
  - uses hidapi (with hidraw backend on linux) to drive the hid device
    directly
- Steam
  - i guess steam input
    - can use evdev
    - can use hidapi to drive the hid device directly
    - can emulate an xbox controller if enabled in settings
  - for games that use steam input api, they either see evdev, the real
    controller, or the emulated xbox controller

  - major ODMs: quanta, compal, etc.
  - OEMs design and contract ODMs to manufacture
  - in fact,
    - when a new soc is developed, soc vendor contracts ODMs to build
      reference designs
      - they are for internal verification and are used as the base for
        OEM/ODM designs
      - intel calls it RVP or CRB
      - qcom calls it CRD
    - ODMs also come up with their reference designs
      - they are for OEMs that do not make their own designs
      - it's sometimes called ORB?
    - OEMs make their designs based on soc reference design or ODM reference
      design
