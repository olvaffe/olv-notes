Kernel KBuild
=============

## Top-level Makefile

* A top-level `make` will have these processes

    make
    make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/x86
    make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/x86/kernel
    make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/x86/kernel/apic
  * All subprocesses will have from `MAKEFLAGS` top-level `make` arguments
  * They will have all `export`ed variables
  * top make also adds `-rR --no-print-directory --include-dir=$(srctree)`
* It includes
  * `scripts/Kbuild.include`, a list of variables
  * `arch/x86/Makefile`, targets and arch sources
  * `include/config/auto.conf`, kernel configs
* All top directories are collected in `vmlinux-dirs`.
  * `$(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=$@` is called on each of them to build all objects and
    `built-in.o`s.
  * `build` is expanded to `-f scripts/Makefile.build obj`
* Have a look at how `vmlinux.lds` is built as an example
  * arch makefile adds `arch/x86/` to `core-y`.
  * It is part of `vmlinux-dirs` and make is called with
    `-f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/x86/`
  * `arch/x86/Kbuild` is included
    * `Kbuild` is preferred over `Makefile` when exists.
  * `scripts/Makefile.lib` is included to transform `kernel/` in `obj-y` into
    * `kernel/` in `subdir-y`
    * `kernel/built-in.o` in `obj-y`
  * make is called again with `obj=arch/x86/kernel/`
  * `cmd_cpp_lds_S` is used to transform `%.lds.S` into `%.lds`.
* `make arch/x86`
  * This target is given as part of `vmlinux-dirs`
  * It runs `$(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=arch/x86/`
  * See `d1f0ae5e2e45e74cff4c3bdefb0fc77608cdfeec`.

## Kconfig

* Top-level Makefile has wildcard target `%config`
* `include/config/auto.conf` and `include/linux/autoconf.h` is generated by
  `make silentoldconfig`
  * It executes `scripts/kconfig/conf`.

## Preparation Targets

* `prepare0`
  * it builds top-level Kbuild, which
  * generates `include/asm/asm-offsets.h` from `arch/x86/kernel/asm-offsets.c`.
  * checks missing syscalls
* `prepare1` depends
  * `include/config/auto.conf`, generated by `silentoldconfig`
  * `include/linux/version.h`, generatedy by makefile itself
  * `include/linux/utsrelease.h`, from `include/config/kernel.release`
  * `include/asm`, symlink to real arch asm directory

## Headers

* Top make runs `scripts/Makefile.headersinst` on `include/` and
  `arch/x86/include/`.
