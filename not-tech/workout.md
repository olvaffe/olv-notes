## Skeletal Muscles

- there are 3 types of muscles
  - cardiac
  - smooth
  - skeletal
- a skeletal muscle cell can be very large
  - 0.1mm in diameter
  - can be 20-30mm in length
  - also called a muscle fiber
- zooming in on a muscle cell, there are many myofibril wrapped in sarcolemma
- the number of muscle cells does not change
- growing muscles can only mean
  - increase muscle cell diameter
  - increase muscle cell length
- muscle strength is related to muscle fiber size, but not propotionally
- there are three types of muscle fibers
  - type 1: slow oxidative
    - slow twitch speed
    - small twitch force
    - high resistance to fatigue
  - type 2: fast oxidative/glycolytic
    - fast twitch speed
    - medium twitch force
    - high resistance to fatigue
  - type 3: fast glycolytic
    - fast twitch speed
    - large twitch force
    - low resistance to fatigue
- endurance training
  - higher frequency
  - longer period
  - lesser force
  - increase mitochondria and thus increase oxidative metabolism
- strength training
  - lower frequency
  - higher force
  - induce hypertrophy
- hypertrophy training focuses on making muscle fibers bigger

## Muscle Groups

- the major ones are
  - chest
    - pectoralis major
    - pectoralis minor
    - serratus anterior
  - shoulders
    - deltoid
  - back
    - trapezius (traps, neck to mid-back)
    - latissimus dorsi (lats, armpit to lower-back)
  - arms
    - bicepts (front of upper arms)
    - triicepts (back of upper arms)
    - forearms (lower arms)
  - abdominals (abs)
    - rectus abdominis (RA, six-pack)
    - transversus abdominis (TA, deep layer supporting organs)
    - internal obliques (IO)
    - external obliques (EO)
  - legs
    - calves (lower legs)
    - hamstrings (back of upper legs)
    - quadriceps (front of upper legs)
    - glutes (butt and hips)
