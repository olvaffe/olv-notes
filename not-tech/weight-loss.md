- calories
  - 1g fat has 9cal
  - 1g carbs has 4 cal
  - 1g protein has 4 cal
- to lose 1kg, one needs to lose 7700cal
  - with calorie deficit of 300 calories per day, it takes 25.6 days to lose
    1kg

  - Breakdown: calories/fat/carbs/protein
    - steak: 150/6/1/21
    - rice: 210/4/40/4
    - pinto beans: 130/2/21/8
    - tomato salsa: 25/0/4/0
    - sour cream: 110/9/2/2
    - double fajita: 40/0/10/2
    - cheese: 110/8/1/6
    - lettuce: 5/0/1/0

## Exercises

- commute: one-way 3mi, 20min
  - 20cal per 10kg
  - at 100kg, 200cal one-way
- walking at 4km/h
  - 25cal per 10kg per hour
  - at 100kg and with a 600m loop, 37cal per loop
    - a loop takes 9min
- jogging at 8km/h
  - 70cal per 10kg per hour
  - at 100kg and with a 600m loop, 100cal per loop
    - a loop takes 4.5min

## Metabolism

- digestion process
  - carbohydrates
    - the amylase in saliva breaks down some carbs and the food is referred to
      as chyme
    - the acid in stomach kills bacteria in the chyme
    - in duodenum, pancreatic amylase breaks chyme down into dextrin and
      maltose
    - the lactase, sucrase, and maltase in small intestine breaks sugars down
      into monosaccharides or single sugars
    - the small intestine aborts and releases them into bloodstream
    - the single sugars are called glucose
  - proteins
    - the hydrochloric acid and proteases in stomach break proteins down into
      chains of amino acids
    - the small intestine breaks them down into amino acids, absorbs and
      releases them into bloodstream
  - fats
    - triglycerides are the scientific term
    - the lipase in salvia breaks some triglycerides down
    - the gastric lipase in the stomach breaks triglycerides down into
      diglycerides and fatty acids
    - more lipase and bile in the small instestine package them into chylomicrons
    - chylomicrons enter the bloodsream through the lymph system
- bloodstream
  - amino acids
    - amino acids are sent to cells for use right away, to repair protein
      structures in different tissues
    - excessive amino acids are not stored and are converted to glucose by the
      liver
  - chylomicrons
    - triglycerides in chylomicrons are absorbed and stored in fat cells and
      the liver
      - the liver can convert triglycerides to glucose (via gluconeogenesis)
    - fatty acids in chylomicros are absorbed and stored in adipocytes
    - the remaining, mostly cholesterol, are sent to the liver
  - glucose
    - glucose can be sent to cells for use right away
    - excessive glucose can be
      - absorbed by the muscles and converted into glycogen
      - absorbed by the liver and converted into glycogen (via glycogenesis) and
        triglycerides (via lipogenesis)
      - these processes are signaled by insulin
- to summarize,
  - carbs provide glucose for energy
    - excess glucose can be converted to glycogen and triglycerides for
      storage
  - proteins provide amino acids for repairs
    - excess amino acids can be converted to glucose
  - fats provide triglycerides and are stored
  - stored glycogen and triglycerides can be converted to glucose
