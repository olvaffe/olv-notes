## Skeletal Muscles

- there are 3 types of muscles
  - cardiac
  - smooth
  - skeletal
- a skeletal muscle cell can be very large
  - 0.1mm in diameter
  - can be 20-30mm in length
  - also called a muscle fiber
- zooming in on a muscle cell, there are many myofibril wrapped in sarcolemma
- the number of muscle cells does not change
- growing muscles can only mean
  - increase muscle cell diameter
  - increase muscle cell length
- muscle strength is related to muscle fiber size, but not propotionally
- there are three types of muscle fibers
  - type 1: slow oxidative
    - slow twitch speed
    - small twitch force
    - high resistance to fatigue
  - type 2: fast oxidative/glycolytic
    - fast twitch speed
    - medium twitch force
    - high resistance to fatigue
  - type 3: fast glycolytic
    - fast twitch speed
    - large twitch force
    - low resistance to fatigue
- endurance training
  - higher frequency
  - longer period
  - lesser force
  - increase mitochondria and thus increase oxidative metabolism
- strength training
  - lower frequency
  - higher force
  - induce hypertrophy
- hypertrophy training focuses on making muscle fibers bigger

## Muscle Groups

- the major ones are
  - chest
    - pectoralis major
    - pectoralis minor
    - serratus anterior
  - shoulders
    - deltoid
  - back
    - trapezius (traps, neck to mid-back)
    - latissimus dorsi (lats, armpit to lower-back)
  - arms
    - bicepts (front of upper arms)
    - triicepts (back of upper arms)
    - forearms (lower arms)
  - abdominals (abs)
    - rectus abdominis (RA, six-pack)
    - transversus abdominis (TA, deep layer supporting organs)
    - internal obliques (IO)
    - external obliques (EO)
  - legs
    - calves (lower legs)
    - hamstrings (back of upper legs)
    - quadriceps (front of upper legs)
    - glutes (butt and hips)

## Equipments

- cardio
  - treadmill
  - elliptical machine (low-impact treadmill)
  - stationary bike
  - rowing machine
- strength
  - chest press
  - lat pulldown
  - leg press
  - smith machine
  - cables
  - dumbbell set
  - barbell

## Sets and Reps

- RM, repetition maximum
  - 1RM: can only do 1 rep at the weight
  - 8RM: can do 8 reps at the weight, with the last 2 reps very difficult
  - beginner should target 8RM or higher
- stregnth training
  - compound exercises
    - <= 6 reps
    - 2-6 sets
    - 2-5 minutes rest
  - isolation exercises
    - <= 8 reps
    - 1-3 sets
- hypertrophy training
  - 6-12 reps
  - 3-6 sets
  - 30-90 seconds rest
  - training volume
    - reps times sets times weight
    - most important factor for hypertrophy
- endurance training
  - >= 12 reps
  - 2-3 sets
  - <=30 seconds rest
- power training
  - 1-5 reps
  - 3-5 sets
  - 2-5 minutes rest

## Routines

- a muscle group needs 48-72 hours to rest after trained
- bro split
  - M-F: one muscle group a day
  - weekends: rest days
- push pull legs
  - push: chest, shoulder, triceps
  - pull: back, biceps
  - legs: quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves
  - can be 3-day, 6-day, or 2-day (push and pull on the same day)
- when combining strengh and cardio, do stregth first
  - not a big deal though

## Lifts

- the big 3 lifts
  - barbell squat
  - bench press
  - deadlift
