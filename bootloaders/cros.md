## Cr50, H1 based security microcontroller

 - Google Security Chip H1
   - <https://osfc.io/uploads/talk/paper/7/gsc_copy.pdf>
   - <https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/ec-development>
   - ARM SC300 core, 8kB boot ROM, 64kB SRAM, 512kB flash
   - USB, I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, etc.
   - flash contains two copies of Cr50 for redundency
   - each copy is devided into RO and RW sections
   - coming out of reboot, it boots to RO first;  RO then boots to RW.
 - Cr50 runs on H1 and implements TPM2, CCD, and U2F
   - the Cr50 firmware is built from Chromium OS EC
   - <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec>
   - Cr50 does not reboot (unless the battery dies)
   - A host device can talk to Cr50, when a SuzyQ cable is used to connect them
   - The AP (the firmware/os runs on the AP CPU) can also talk to Cr50 via TPM
 - Suzy-Q allows a host device to talk to DUT's Cr50
   - It is a USB-A to USB-C cable.  The USB-C end is non-standard.  It needs
     to be connect to a specific port of DUT and in a specific orientation to
     work.
   - Once connected, several USB devices show up to the host
     - 18d1:501f is Suzy-Q itself
       - 18d1:501b is Servo v4
     - 18d1:5014 is Cr50
   - Cr50 makes three TTY endpoints available to the host
     - requires usbserial in the host kernel; /dev/ttyUSBx
     - first TTY is Cr50 console
     - second TTY is AP console
     - third TTY is EC console
   - Servo v4 itself also has three USB endpoints that are TTY devices
 - gsctool is a helper tool to talk to Cr50
   - On host, it uses Cr50 console over serial
   - On DUT, it ueses TPM
   - `emerge ec-utils`, to get gsctool
   - `emerge-<board> chromeos-cr50`, to get the latest RW images for DUT
     - prod image is for MP devices
     - pre-pvt image is for pre-pvt devices and developers
   - `gsctool <cr50-firmware>`, to update the RW firmware
   - `gsctool -f`, or type `version` in Cr50 console, to get the RW firmware version
 - Servo
   - `emerge hdctools`, hardware debug and control tools
   - `sudo servo_updater -b servo_v4` to update the firmware
   - `servod` to start the servo daemon
   - `dut-control`
 - `flash_ec` and `flashrom` are other ways to update Cr50
   - on host: `flash_ec --board=<boardname> [--image=<path/to/ec.bin>]`
   - on DUT: `flashrom -p ec -w <path-to/ec.bin>`
   - untested

## coreboot

 - coreboot lives on SPI storage
   - use `futility update` or `flashrom` to flash a new image
   - might need to disable write-protection, `flashrom --wp-disable`
   - to backup, `sudo flashrom -V -p raiden_debug_spi:target=AP -r old.bin`
   - to update, `sudo flashrom -V -p raiden_debug_spi:target=AP -w new.bin`
   - it takes multiple (5-10) minutes to run!  Be patient.
 - Keyboard shortcuts
   - need to use AP console if physical keyboard does not work in coreboot
   - enter recovery mode: hold ESC and F3/Refresh, then press power button to boot
   - enter developer mode: while in recovery mode, press Ctrl-D
   - boot from usb: at developer mode warning or red screen, press Ctrl-U
     - ctrl-D to boot from disk/ufs
     - ctrl-N to boot from network
     - ctrl-U to boot from USB
       - require "crossystem dev_boot_usb=1" or "enable_dev_usb_boot" in shell first
       - USB stick holds a live image
       - run "chromeos-install" to install to disk/ufs
 - coreboot loads depthcharge payload which boots cros
   - it can be hacked to load SeaBIOS or TianoCore to boot linux
 - depthcharge
   - behavior partly controlled by GBB flags
     - set_gbb_flags.sh or
     - "futility gbb -g --flags <bios>" to get the GBB flag in a bios
   - crossystem reads/writes system properties from
     - nv storage
     - /sys/devices/platform/chromeos_acpi/VDAT (x86)
     - /proc/device-tree/firmware/chromeos/vboot-shared-data (ARM)
