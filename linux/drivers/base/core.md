Kernel Driver Core
==================

## Initialization

- `devices_init` is called from `driver_init` during driver subsystem init
  - `devices_kset` is created with `kset_create_and_add` with no parent
    kobject (`/sys/devices`)
  - `dev_kobj` is created with `kobject_create_and_add` with no parent kobject
    (`/sys/dev`)
  - `sysfs_dev_block_kobj` is created with `kobject_create_and_add` under
    `dev_kobj` (`/sys/dev/block`)
  - `sysfs_dev_char_kobj` is created with `kobject_create_and_add` under
    `dev_kobj` (`/sys/dev/char`)
- if a device has a major, `device_add` calls
  - `device_create_sys_dev_entry` to create a symlink under
    `/sys/dev/{block,char}`
  - `devtmpfs_create_node` to create a node in devtmpfs
- `hypervisor_init` creates `hypervisor_kobj`, `/sys/hypervisor`

## Device Registration

- `device_register`
  - `dev->kobj.kset` is initialized to `devices_kset`
  - for a non-class device, its parent is
    - the explicitly specified parent, if specified,
    - the default root (`dev_root`) of the bus, if exists,
    - NULL
  - for a class device, its parent is
    - `virtual_device_parent`, if none specified
    - the explicitly specified parent, if the parent has a class
    - a glue dir
- many of the top-level nodes are PMUs registered by `perf_pmu_register`
  - `/sys/devices/breakpoint` from `init_hw_breakpoint`
  - `/sys/devices/cpu` from `init_hw_perf_events`
  - `/sys/devices/cstate_core` and `/sys/devices/cstate_pkg` from
    `cstate_init`
  - `/sys/devices/i915` from `i915_pmu_register`
  - `/sys/devices/intel_bts` from `bts_init`
  - `/sys/devices/intel_pt` from `pt_init`
  - `/sys/devices/msr` from `msr_init`
  - `/sys/devices/power` from `rapl_pmu_init`
  - `/sys/devices/software` from `perf_event_init`
  - `/sys/devices/tracepoint`, `/sys/devices/kprobe`, and
    `/sys/devices/uprobe` from `perf_tp_register`
  - `/sys/devices/uncore_*` from `uncore_pmu_register`
- `/sys/devices/isa` is by `isa_bus_init`
- `/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00` is by `acpi_device_add` on `ACPI_SYSTEM_HID`
- `/sys/devices/pci0000:00` is by `pci_register_host_bridge`
- `/sys/devices/platform` is by `platform_bus_init`
- `/sys/devices/pnp0` is by `pnp_register_protocol`
- `/sys/devices/wakeup0` is by `pm_autosleep_init`
- `/sys/devices/system` is a kset by `buses_init`
  - `cpu` is from `cpu_dev_init`
  - `memory` is from `memory_dev_init`
  - don't use `subsys_system_register` in new code
- `/sys/devices/virtual` is by `virtual_device_parent`
  - `workqueue` is from `wq_sysfs_init`, a virtual subsys
  - `dma_heap` is from `dma_heap_add`, a class device with no parent

## Device Link

- <https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/device_link.html>
- device hierarchy forms a tree
  - each child depends on its parent
- device link turns device hierarchy into a DAG
  - each consumer depends on its producer(s)

## Device Model

- `/sys/devices` is hierarchical.
- The others might not.  The goal of other directories is not to give a
  hierarchical view of the device tree.
  - E.g. `/sys/bus/pci/devices` contains all pci devices in a flat view.
- A SDHCI host controller lives on the PCI bus and has class mmc_host.  The card
  inserted lives on mmc bus, and is a child of the mmc_host?
- `struct device` has
  - `struct device *parent`, the device's parent
  - `struct device_private *p`, for deivce core use, like the device's children
  - `struct device_type *type`, the type of the device
  - `struct bus_type *bus`, the type of bus the device is on
  - `struce device_driver *driver`, the driver of the device
  - `struct class *class`, the class of the device
- A device with `class` is called a class device.  When a class device is
  added, it is put under a subdirectory with its class name of its parent,
  unless its parent is also a class device.
  - E.g. `pcspkr` has no class and `platform` is its parent.  It will be
    found under `/devices/platform/pcspkr`.
  - E.g. `hwmon0` is a hwmon class device and it has no parent.
    It will be found under `/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon0`.
  - E.g. `hwmon1` is a hwmon class device and `coretemp.0` is its parent.  It
    will be found under `/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon1`.
- Where a device is put is decided by `get_device_parent`.
  - It decides the device's kobject parent.
  - the device's `class` and `parent` can be null.
  - if both of them is null, the device has no kobject parent.
  - if `class` is null and `parent` is non-null, the parent's kobject is the
    device's kobject parent.
  - if `class` is non-null, the kobject parent is
    - if the device has a `parent` and the `parent` has a `class`, then the
      parent's kobject is the device's kobject parent.
    - if there is no `parent`, `virtual` is used as a parent without `class`.
    - if the `parent` has no `class`, a new kobject is created and added as the
      parent's child and as the device's kobject parent.
- It should be noted that what is in the sysfs are decided by `kset` and
  `kobject`.
  - The hierarchy is not decided by device and its parent.  Otherwise, a device
    without class or parent would be found under `/`, not `/devices`.
  - A `kobject` is a directory holding files.
  - A `kset` is a `kobject` that can also hold `kobject`s.
- There are `struct device platform_bus` and `struct bus_type platform_bus_type`.
  - `platform_bus` has no class, nor parent, nor bus.  It can be found under
    `/devices/platform`.
  - `platform_bus_type` is not a device.  It has a `subsys` kobject whose kset
    is `bus_kset`, and this makes it accessible under `/bus/platform`.  It has
    two ksets under `subsys`, which correspond to `/bus/platform/devices` and
    `/bus/platform/drivers`.
  - Bus is used for device-driver matchings.
- Take a look at SDHCI controller attached to the PCI bus.
  - There is a PCI device `/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:03:0b.3`.
  - When its driver, `sdhci_pci`, is attached, it creates a mmc_host class
    device whose parent is the pci device
    `/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:03:0b.3/mmc_host/mmc0`
  - When an SD card is inserted, the card is a device with parent mmc0
    `/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:03:0b.3/mmc_host/mmc0/mmc0:e624`.
    - It lives on the `mmc` bus `/bus/mmc/devices/mmc0:e624`.
- It seems that class devices are usually functions of a physical device.
  - Those not under this category can be found under `/devices/virtual`.
