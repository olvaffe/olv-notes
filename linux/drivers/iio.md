Kernel IIO
==========

## Core

- the iio subsystem is for sensors
  - it is similar to input or hwmon subsys
    - input subsys is for human inputs
    - hwmon subsys is for low-freq sensors
  - common types of iio sensors are
    - adc
    - dac
    - accelerometers
    - gyroscopes
    - color and light sensors
    - magnetometers
    - pressure sensors
    - proximity sensors
    - etc
