Kernel trace
============

## Initialization

- configs
  - `CONFIG_FTRACE` enables the tracing infra, which includes
    - `CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS`
    - `CONFIG_NOP_TRACER`
    - `CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING`
    - more
  - `CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER` enables the function tracer
    - it builds the kernel with `CC_FLAGS_FTRACE`
      - `-pg` inserts a call to `mcount` to all functions for tracing
  - `CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE` dynamically patches the call to `mcount`
  - `CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS` eanbles syscall tracing (unrelated to function
    tracer)
  - `CONFIG_ENABLE_DEFAULT_TRACERS` enables the default tracers
    - this enables sched events and tracepoints
    - any real tracer enables them too
    - the idea is that
      - if any real tracer is enabled, this is unnecessary and will be hidden
      - if no real tracer is enabled, this can be used to enable sched events
        and tracepoints
- `start_kernel` calls
  - `ftrace_init` patches `mcount` calls to nop
    - `ftrace_update_code` is called on each call and `ftrace_init_nop` does
      the patching
  - `early_trace_init`
    - `tracer_alloc_buffers`
      - it inits `global_trace`
      - it calls `register_tracer` to register `nop_trace`
      - `init_function_trace` registers `function_trace`
      - `init_events` calls `register_trace_event` to register trace events
        - these are not tracepoints
  - `trace_init` calls `trace_event_init`
    - `init_ftrace_syscalls` inits syscall tracing
    - `event_trace_enable` adds `trace_event_call` to `ftrace_events`
      - these are tracepoints
- `late_initcall_sync(late_trace_init)`
- `core_initcall(tracefs_init)`
  - `sysfs_create_mount_point` creates `/sys/kernel/tracing` as a mountpoint
- `fs_initcall(tracer_init_tracefs)`
  - `tracing_init_dentry` automounts legacy `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing`
  - `event_trace_init` adds `available_events`
  - `init_tracer_tracefs` adds a bunch of files
    - `available_tracers`
    - `current_tracer`
    - many more
  - `create_trace_instances` adds `instances`
    - `mkdir instances/foo` calls `trace_array_create`
      - this creates a new `trace_array` rather than using the `global_trace`
      - `tr->current_trace` is set to `nop_trace`
      - `allocate_trace_buffers` allocs the ring buffers
      - `trace_array_create_dir`
      - the trace array is added to `ftrace_trace_arrays`

## Tracepoints

- to define tracepoints, create a header that
  - defines `CREATE_TRACE_POINTS`
  - defines `TRACE_SYSTEM`
  - include `linux/tracepoint.h`  
  - `DEFINE_EVENT` defines a tracepoint
    - it expands to `DECLARE_TRACE` which expands to `__DECLARE_TRACE`
      - this defines `trace_##name` as an inline function
        - if `CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS` is not defined, the inline function is nop
      - the inline function checks if the tracepoint is enabled and calls
        `__traceiter_##name`
  - include `trace/define_trace.h`
    - this is nop unless `CREATE_TRACE_POINTS` is defined
    - otherwise, it re-includes everything and re-expands `DEFINE_EVENT`
    - this time, `DEFINE_EVENT` expands to `DEFINE_TRACE` which expands to
      `DEFINE_TRACE_FN`
      - this defines `struct tracepoint __tracepoint_##name` in
        `__tracepoints` section
        - each tracepoint has a list of probe functions at `tp->funcs`
        - other probe frameworks can hook into tracepoints as well
      - it also defines `__traceiter_##name` function called from the inline
        function
      - the traceiter function calls active probe functions that are currently
        on the `tp->funcs` list
    - it then includes `trace/trace_events.h` which re-includes everything a
      few more times
      - this define `trace_event_raw_event_##call` as a probe function
      - it also defines `struct trace_event_call event_##call` in
        `_ftrace_events` section
        - if `CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING` is not defined, these symbols are
          discarded
- `trace_##name` is the entrypoint of a tracepoint
  - it checks if the tracepoint is enabled first
  - if enabled, it calls `__traceiter_##name` which calls the list of probe
    functions at `tp->funcs`
- when userspace writes 1 to `/sys/kernel/tracing/events/drm/enable`,
  - `system_enable_write` calls `ftrace_event_enable_disable` to enable each
    tracepoint
  - `ftrace_event_enable_disable` calls `call->class->reg` which is
    `trace_event_reg`
  - `trace_event_reg` calls `tracepoint_probe_register` to register
    `trace_event_raw_event_##call` as a probe function
    - this adds the probe function to `tp->funcs`
    - when called,
      - `trace_event_buffer_reserve`
      - whatever the traceponit wants to record to the ring buffer
      - `trace_event_buffer_commit`
- when userspace writes 1 to `/sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on`,
  - `rb_simple_write` calls `tracer_tracing_on` or `tracer_tracing_off`
  - `ring_buffer_record_on` enables the ring buffer
- when userspace reads from `/sys/kernel/tracing/trace`
  - `tracing_open` handles open
  - `s_show` handles reads
  - `print_trace_line` prints a line
  - `print_trace_fmt`
- configs
  - `CONFIG_FTRACE` is the top-level menu
  - when no tracer is enabled at all, `CONFIG_TRACING` is not set
    - no `CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS`
      - `struct tracepoint __tracepoint_##name` is not defined
      - `trace_##name` is nop
    - no `CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING`
      - `_ftrace_events` is discarded by the linker and thus no
        `struct trace_event_call event_##call`
      - `trace_events.c` is not compiled
  - when no real tracer is needed, `CONFIG_ENABLE_DEFAULT_TRACERS` can be used
    to select `CONFIG_TRACING` to enable tracepoints
  - when any real tracer is enabled, it selects `CONFIG_GENERIC_TRACER` which
    selects `CONFIG_TRACING` to enable tracepoints

## Syscalls

- `CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS` is a tracer for syscalls
- the linker will include `__syscalls_metadata` section
- syscall definitions will expand `SYSCALL_METADATA` to
  - `static struct trace_event_call __used event_enter_##sname` and
  - `static struct trace_event_call __used event_exit_##sname` in
    `_ftrace_events` section
  - `static struct syscall_metadata __used __syscall_meta_##sname` in
    `__syscalls_metadata` section
- when a tracepoint is enabled, `syscall_enter_register` or
  `syscall_exit_register` is called
- when a tracepoint is reached, `fields_array` of `event_class_syscall_enter`
  or `event_class_syscall_exit` is recorded
- when the trace is printed, `print_syscall_enter` or `print_syscall_exit`
  prints the formatted line
