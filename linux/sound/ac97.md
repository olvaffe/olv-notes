## AC'97

- Audio Codec '97, developed by intel and codec suppliers in 1997
  - DC (digital controller) is typically in the southbridge
  - AC-LINK is the interface between DC and codecs
  - codecs have AC-LINK connectors on one side and analog audio connectors on
    the other side
- there are many different DC drivers
  - AC97 standardizes DC-codec interface but not CPU-DC interface
- a typical DC driver
  - in the probe function,
    - `snd_devm_card_new` creates an `snd_card` from the underlying device
    - `snd_pcm_new` creates an `snd_pcm` from the `snd_card`
    - `snd_ac97_bus` creates an `snd_ac97_bus` from the `snd_card` and the
      driver-defined `snd_ac97_bus_ops`
      - this calls `snd_device_new` to add an `snd_device` to the
        `snd_card`
    - `snd_ac97_mixer` creates an `snd_ac97_mixer` from the `snd_ac97_bus`
  - `snd_ac97_mixer` does a lot of stuff
    - it determines which controls are available
      - it talks to the codec using the ac97 protocol
      - essentially, it consists of all drivers for all known ac97 codecs
    - `snd_ac97_mixer_build` calls `snd_ctl_add` to add various `snd_kcontrol`
      to the `snd_card`
- `CONFIG_SND_INTEL8X0` is for Intel 82801AA and others
  - qemu and crosvm emulate Intel 82801AA, dev id 0x2415
  - it selects `CONFIG_SND_AC97_CODEC`
  - it registers a pci driver `intel8x0_driver`
  - in the probe function, it calls `snd_ac97_bus` and calls `snd_ac97_mixer`
    for each codec
- there are 3 kinds of drivers
  - most drivers such as `CONFIG_SND_INTEL8X0` are typical DC drivers
    - they depend on `CONFIG_AC97_BUS`
  - `CONFIG_SND_PXA2XX_SOC_AC97` appears to be the only driver ported to the
    new framework
    - it depends on `CONFIG_AC97_BUS_NEW` instead
  - then there is also `CONFIG_SND_SOC_AC97_CODEC`
    - it is an asoc codec driver using `snd_ac97_bus` and `snd_ac97_mixer`
