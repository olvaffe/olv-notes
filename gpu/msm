## MDSS

 - componentized device
   - when a subdevice is probed, add it with "component_add"
   - when the master device is probed, describe the required subdevices and
     add the master with "component_master_add_with_match"
     - it will attempt to bind the master device to its driver
     - the driver init function calls "component_bind_all" to bind the
       subdevices to their respective drivers
 - "msm_drm_init" is the driver init function for the master device
   - it initializes MDSS with "dpu_mdss_init" first
   - it then binds all subdevices
   - the binding of DPU initializes KMS with "dpu_bind"
   - it then calls kms's "hw_init"
   - it starts a "crtc_commit:%d" and a "crtc_event:%d" thread for each crtc
   - "drm_vblank_init"

## Memory Management

 - ioctls
   - MSM_GEM_NEW
     - msm_ioctl_gem_new takes a size and a flags
	- it kzallocs a msm_gem_object, which is also a drm_gem_object
	- the gem object is added to the device's private inactive_list
	- drm_gem_object_init is called to set up filp
	- drm_gem_handle_create is called and the handle is the id into file's private object_idr
   - DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE
     - drm_gem_handle_delete is called and it deletes the handle in file's private object_idr
     - drm_gem_object_release_handle is called
       - if there are prime handles, they are removed from file's private prime table
       - if there are vmas with this file's tag, they are removed
       - if there is a name, it is removed from the device's object_name_idr
       - if exported as dma_buf, the handle is removed
   - DRM_IOCTL_GEM_FLINK
     - it creates a name for the BO and adds the name to device's object_name_idr
   - DRM_IOCTL_GEM_OPEN
     - it looks up a BO using its name, and create a handle to the file's object_idr
   - DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD
     - it looks up a BO from the file's object_idr
     - it calls drm_gem_prime_export and save the dma_buf to BO's dma_buf
     - it inserts the dma_buf into file's prime table
     - it finds an fd for the dma_buf and return the fd
     - if the BO was imported, use the original dma_buf
     - if the BO has been exported, use the same dma_buf
   - DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE
     - if the dma-buf was already imported or exported, return
     - if the dma-buf was created by the device, grab the backing BO
     - if the dma-buf points to a non-GEM BO, create a new BO around its pages
     - create a handle for the BO in file's object_idr
     - add the dma_buf to the file's prime table
   - MSM_GEM_INFO
     - when MSM_INFO_IOVA is set, return the offset in GPU address_space
       - create a new VMA
       - get_pages() to get the pages and sg table
       - msm_gem_map_vma to initialize the VMA and to set up IOMMU
       - return the offset of the VMA
     - otherwise, intialize obj->vma_node within dev->vma_offset_manager and
       returns the VMA offset
   - MSM_GEM_MADVISE
   - MSM_GEM_CPU_PREP
   - MSM_GEM_CPU_FINI
 - mmap
   - use the VMA to look up the object from dev->vma_offset_manager
   - drm_vma_node_is_allowed checks if the object has an associlated file private handle
   - set vma->vm_ops to driver's vm_operations_struct
   - in fault handler, get_pages() and update MMU
 - reservation_object
   - each newly created BO owns a reservation_object
   - each dma-buf import creates a BO with the reservation_object of the dma-buf
   - a reservation_object can hold an exclusive dma_fence and a list of shared dma_fence

## Command Submission and Fence

 - Fence
   - msm_fence_context is a seqno-based per-ring fence context
     - it goes by the name "gpu-ring-%d"
     - each dma_fence allocated from the context is assocaited with a seqno (++fctx->last_fence)
     - each bo submission is assocaited with a dma_fence (and its seqno)
     - when a submission completes, msm_update_fence is called to update
       fctx->completed_fence to the submission's seqno.
     - to check if a dma_fence is signaled, (fctx->completed_fence >= fence->seqno)
   - each submission may have a fence fd input
     - it must point a valid sync_file if not -1
     - sync_file_get_fence converts it to a dma_fence
     - if the dma_fence is not from ring->fctx, do a blocking dma_fence_wait
   - each submission may request a fence fd output
     - it converts the dma_fence associated with the submission into a sync_file
     - and return the fd to the userspace
 - MSM_GEM_SUBMIT
   - a submission consists of a bunch of drm_msm_gem_submit_cmd and drm_msm_gem_submit_bo
     - each bo has a flag, indicating
   - submit_lookup_objects initializes submit->bos from drm_msm_gem_submit_bo array
     - it looks up handles from file->object_idr to get BOs
     - it temporarily sets iova of each BOs to the presumed address set by userspace
   - submit_lock_objects locks the BOs' reservation_object
     - if failed to lock any BO, it does a slow lock on the BO
   - submit_fence_sync waits for the BOs to be ready
     - if the BO is only read-only by the submission, reserve a shared fence
       for the BO.  The shared fence makes sure no one writes to the BO before
       the submission completes.
     - return early if the explicit fence fd input is used
     - otherwise, msm_gem_sync_object is called
       - if there is a explicit fence for the BO (someone wrote to the BO), do
         a CPU wait with dma_fence_wait
       - if we are going to write to the BO, do CPU wait on all shared fences
         of the BO
   - submit_pin_objects pins all BOs and finalizes their IOVAs
     - if presumed address is correct, mark BO_VALID
     - otherwise, clear BO_VALID.  Need to apply reloc.
   - for each drm_msm_gem_submit_cmd,
     - lookup the BO (which is specified using drm_msm_gem_submit_bo)
     - remember the type, offseted IOVA, size
     - if reloc is required, submit_reloc applies the reloc list
   - msm_gpu_submit is called
     - it calls msm_gpu_hw_init in case the GPU was suspended
     - "submit->seqno = ++ring->seqno", which the ring's seqno, unrelated to fence seqno
     - it dumps the submission with msm_rd_dump_submit, if the debugfs file is opened
     - it updates GPU SW counters
     - for each BO, if marked for reading or writing, call msm_gem_move_to_active
       - this adds the submission's dma_fence to the reservation_object of the BO
       - also move the BO from drm inactive_list to gpu active_list
     - a6xx_submit is called
       - for each cmd,
         - emit CP_INDIRECT_BUFFER_PFE with the cmd's IOVA offset and size
       - emit REG_A6XX_CP_SCRATCH_REG to write submit->seqno (ring seqno) to scratch reg
       - emit CP_EVENT_WRITE
         - arg1: request timestamp and an interrupt
         - arg2: address of msm_rbmemptrs.fence
         - arg3: submit->seqno
         - this writes submit->seqno to msm_rbmemptrs.fence
       - write to REG_A6XX_CP_RB_WPTR to update write pointer
   - msm_gpu_retire is triggered by the irq requested by msm_gpu_submit 
     - it wakes up retire_worker
       - update_fences calls msm_update_fence with all completed submission fences
       - for each completed submission, its msm_gem_submit is freed
     - it updates SW counters
 - other ioctls
   - MSM_SUBMITQUEUE_NEW
     - create a file-local msm_submitqueue for a ring buffer
   - MSM_SUBMITQUEUE_CLOSE
     - destroy a msm_submitqueue
   - MSM_WAIT_FENCE is legacy path and calls msm_wait_fence to wait for a specified seqno

## GPU

 - When device "qcom,adreno" is bound,
   - adreno_info is determined
         {
                .rev = ADRENO_REV(6, 3, 0, ANY_ID),

   - init is called to get an "msm_gpu"
     - a6xx_gpu_init calls adreno_gpu_init with 1 ring
     - msm_gpu_init creates a 4G address space as requested
     - it also creates 1 msm_ringbuffer as requested
       - a 32K BO
       - start/end/enxt/cur as indices
       - submits is a list of ?
       - fctx is a fence context goes by the name "gpu-ring-%d"

 - when the DRM device is opened, adreno_load_gpu is called
   - it loads the GPU firmware

   - calls msm_gpu_hw_init
