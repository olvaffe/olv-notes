## Utgard

- GLES 2.0
- non-unified shader cores
- one vertex core
  - the vertex core and the tiler share a small L2
  - shade one or two vertices serially
  - output to fixed-function tiler for primitive assembly, clipping, cullling,
    and tile list generation
- multiple fragment cores
  - they share a larger L2
  - L2 size is usually `num_cores * 32KB`
  - data flow within a core
    - tile list reader
    - rasterizer
    - early zs tester
    - fragment thread creater
    - threads doing load, texture, arithmetic, and then retire
    - late zs tester
    - blender
    - tile memory
    - tile writeback
  - a core can run up to 128 threads to hide cache misses and memory latency
  - ISA is SIMD and operate on vec4 fp16

## Midgard

- GLES 3.2
- unified shader cores
- a L2 cache shared by all shader cores
  - size is `num_cores * (32KB or 64KB)`
- given a render pass
  - the driver submits geometry workload to HW first
  - the geometry queue block dispatches the workload to shader cores
  - the driver then submits fragment workload to HW
  - the fragment queue block dispatches the workload to shader cores
- a shader core consists of
  - fixed-function part
    - tile list reader
    - rasterizer
    - early zs tester
    - vertex or fragment thread creator
  - programmable tripipe
    - thread pool
    - three types of pipelines
      - one load/store pipeline w/ L1
      - one texture pipeline w/ L1
      - one or more arithmetic pipelines
	- 128-bit SIMD (4 fp32 or 8 fp16 or 16 i8)

  - more fixed-function parts
    - late zs tester
    - blender
    - tile memory
    - tile writeback
- 16x16 tiles

## Bifrost

- "The Bifrost GPU architecture and the ARM Mali-G71 GPU"
  - by Jem Davies
- a L2 cache shared by all shader cores
  - size is `num_cores * (64KB or 128KB)`
  - full coherency
- up to 32 unified shader cores, where each core consists of
  - a compute frontend
    - quad creator
  - a fragment frontend
    - tile list reader
    - rasterizer
    - early zs tester
    - quad creator
  - a quad manager
    - warp manager
  - up to three execution engines, each
    - 32-bit scalar ISA
    - bifrost uses 4-lane quad-parallel vectorization (SIMT...)
      - a quad is 4 scalar threads executed in lockdep
      - one quad at a time executes in each pipeline stage
      - each thread fills a 32-bit lane of the hardware
      - 4 threads all doing a vec fp32 add take 3 cycles
    - midgard uses 4-lane SIMD vectorization
      - one thread at a time executes in each pipeline stage
      - each thread must fill the width of the hardware
      - 4 threads all doing a SIMD vec3 fp32 add take 4 cycles
  - load/store unit
  - attribute unit
  - varying unit
  - texture units (one or two)
  - zs/blend units (one or two)
    - late zs tester
    - blender
    - tile memory
    - tile writeback
- geometry pipeline
  - instead of 'shade -> assembly -> clip/cull`
  - it does 'assembly -> position shade -> clip/cull -> varying shade`
  - specifically,
    - tiler fetches indices for primitive assembly
    - position shading fetches and transforms only positions
    - tiler clips/culls and stores
      - transformed positions
      - polyton list 
    - varying shading fetches attributes and stores varyings
    - fraghment shading reads back
      - transformed positions
      - polyton list 
      - varyings
  - it is beneficial to have two packed buffers, one for positions and one for
    attributes
