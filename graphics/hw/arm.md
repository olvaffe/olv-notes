- Performance Counters

    - there is a counter that increments every gpu cycle, which is subjected
      to dvfs and pm
    - `$MaliGPUCyclesAnyQueueActive` increments when any queue has any work in
      a gpu cycle
      - gpu utilization is thus `$MaliGPUCyclesAnyQueueActive / GpuCycles * 100`
    - `$MaliShaderCoreCyclesAnyWorkloadActive` increments when any shader core
      has any work in a shader core cycle
      - shader core may have a lower freq than `GpuCycles` on some devices
      - on such devices, shader core utilization is never 100%
    - `$MaliShaderCoreCyclesExecutionCoreActive` increments when the shader
      core has any warp
      - shader core includes the entire fs pipeline (rasterizer, eu, blender)
        - compute makes use of eu only
      - eu utilization is thus
        `$MaliShaderCoreCyclesExecutionCoreActive / $MaliShaderCoreCyclesAnyWorkloadActive * 100`

    and tile list generation
- multiple fragment cores
  - they share a larger L2
  - L2 size is usually `num_cores * 32KB`
  - data flow within a core

    - rasterizer
    - early zs tester
    - fragment thread creater
    - threads doing load, texture, arithmetic, and then retire
    - late zs tester
    - blender
    - tile memory
    - tile writeback

      - each thread fills a 32-bit lane of the hardware
      - 4 threads all doing a vec fp32 add take 3 cycles
    - midgard uses 4-lane SIMD vectorization

  - instead of 'shade -> assembly -> clip/cull`
  - it does 'assembly -> position shade -> clip/cull -> varying shade`
  - specifically,
    - tiler fetches indices for primitive assembly
    - position shading fetches and transforms only positions
    - tiler clips/culls and stores
      - transformed positions
